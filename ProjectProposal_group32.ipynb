    "Air pollution is a major respiratory health risk; it has been linked deaths in the U.S as well as decreasing life expectancy. The biggest contributor to air pollution are from automobiles, which releases high concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as $NO_{x}$, $PM_{2.5}$, $CO$, and $SO_{2}$ [1]. These greenhouse gases (GHG) are detrimental to the environment as well as human health. Most vehicles release GHG when they are being driven. However, electric vehicles produce fewer emissions as it does not emit exhaust from the tailpipe [2]. Instead, most electric vehicles' emissions come from electric power plants. This results in fewer GHG emissions compared to an internal combustion vehicle,  decreasing photochemical smog and improving air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of electric vehicles have exponentially increased from 2011 - 2018 [3][4], while the average air pollutants concentrations in the U.S has steadily declined and air quality has been improving [5]. Studies have found that adopting electric vehicles has a positive impact on air quality by reducing carbon and other pollutants emissions [6]. Transportation accounts for over 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, so by switching to an electric vehicle, we can reduce our GHG emissions and improve air quality.\n",

    "The ideal dataset we want are the trends of different pollutants ($NO_{x}$, $PM_{2.5}$, $CO$, and $SO_{2}$) over ten years. The different pollutants data are collected from U.S EPA Air Quality System. We want to focus on the increase in sales of electric vehicles, which can be collected from Argonne National Laboratory. There is no longer a free data source that releases the sales of electric vehicles by make and model on a monthly basis, instead it is released quarterly. Edison Electric Institute also has the number of electric vehicles on the road in the U.S. These data are in csv format. We would like to see the trends of each pollutant as well as air quality compared to the rise in sales of electric vehicles. "
